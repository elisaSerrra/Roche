  The exercise is to check the validation of a CDS in a string with the regualar expression.

def check_cds(string):
    """
    if cds is not verified, print the start of the string because could be not standard
    """
    pattern = "^(ATG)([ATGC]{3})+(TAA|TGA|TAG)$" #start codon + multiples of 3 of this group [] + end codon
    print("\n")
    for elem in self.cds_ls:
            if not(re.search(pattern, elem.seq)):
                print(x.RED+"CDS combined with "+x.END,elem.name,x.RED+" could be not valid. Starts with:"+x.END,elem.seq[0:3])
            else:
                print(x.RED+"CDS combined with "+x.END,elem.name,x.RED+" is valid! Starts with:"+x.END,elem.seq[0:3])
