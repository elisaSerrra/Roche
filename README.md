# Roche
coding for Roche application

The R code presents a part of my project thesis titled :"Personalization of the adaptive dosing protocol of the Eltrombopag and Pegasys co-treatment for
HCV patients with Q-Learning algorithm". I used RsSimulx package to simulate the pharmaceutical response on the virtual patients.

File "main_training.R" coding the learning of the Q-matrix, 213 Q-matrix, one for each virtual patients. At the end of the learning each Q-Matrix represents the better "action" (dose adjustment) for each "state" (state of the patient) for each patient.

File "bioinformatics.txt" is a small part of exercise carried out for the examination of bioinformatics.
